**DM2** provides several Windows enhancements that may help in every-day work. One of the nicest and most popular features of **DM2** is minimizing windows to _floating iconsÂ®_ (a unique feature!) freeing both task bar and tray bar space. Moreover, **DM2** can manipulate windows in various ways: minimize to tray, make them standing always on-top over all other windows, roll to caption, resize, align to screen borders, hide, set the opacity etc. **DM2** also helps with Open/Save dialog boxes, by providing user-defined menu with favorites and recent files and folders. Plenty of program's settings options will satisfy most of requirements.

And that is not all! **DM2** also supports _custom plugins_, which further enhances the program and that usually covers some more specific functionalities. So, from this aspect, one may think of DM2 as a small, but robust manager for all kind of plugins. Find what you need, plug it in, and use it:)

**DM2** is _free_ for use. Source is released under the terms of the [GPL license](LICENSE).
